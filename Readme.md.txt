## Introduction:
Welcome to the "Development of Slow and Fast Division Algorithms for Computer Architecture" repository for the Intel Unnati Industrial Training in Summer 2023. This internship aimed to develop efficient division algorithms for computer architecture, with a specific focus on the Intel FPGA Cyclone V. The primary goal of this project was to enhance computing capabilities and efficiency by designing and implementing novel division algorithms that outperform traditional approaches.

## Development Environment:
The development process for this project utilized the Intel Quartus Prime Lite platform. For implementation, the hardware description language Verilog, widely used in FPGA design, was chosen.

## Objectives:
The main objectives of the project were as follows:
1. Develop a Finite State Machine (FSM) based on the design specifications.
2. Implement the FSM in Verilog HDL.
3. Conduct simulation and verification using appropriate test cases.

## Summary:
The project's timeline and activities can be summarized as follows:
- Week 1: Built the FSM, validated test cases, and generated the block diagram for the design.
- Week 2: Created a test bench, tested FSM functionality, generated Verilog code, and performed code coverage analysis.
- Week 3: Synthesized the Verilog code to achieve timing closure, analyzed area and power reports, and applied timing restrictions.
- Week 4: Completed the project report, published the code, functioning model, and video demo on GitHub, and implemented the design on the selected FPGA.

## Division Algorithms:
The repository contains implementations of the following division algorithms:
- Goldschmidt Method (Fast Division)
- Long Division Method (Slow Division)
